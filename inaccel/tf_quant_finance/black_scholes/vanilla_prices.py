  Args:
    volatilities: Real `Tensor` of any shape and dtype. The volatilities to
      expiry of the options to price.
    strikes: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype and compatible shape as
      `volatilities`. The strikes of the options to be priced.
    expiries: A real `Tensor` of same dtype and compatible shape as
      `volatilities`. The expiry of each option. The units should be such that
      `expiry * volatility**2` is dimensionless.
    spots: A real `Tensor` of any shape that broadcasts to the shape of the
      `volatilities`. The current spot price of the underlying. Either this
      argument or the `forwards` (but not both) must be supplied.
    forwards: A real `Tensor` of any shape that broadcasts to the shape of
      `volatilities`. The forwards to maturity. Either this argument or the
      `spots` must be supplied but both must not be supplied.
    discount_rates: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `volatilities` and of the shape that broadcasts with `volatilities`.
      If not `None`, discount factors are calculated as e^(-rT),
      where r are the discount rates, or risk free rates. At most one of
      discount_rates and discount_factors can be supplied.
      Default value: `None`, equivalent to r = 0 and discount factors = 1 when
      discount_factors also not given.
    continuous_dividends: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `volatilities` and of the shape that broadcasts with `volatilities`.
      If not `None`, `cost_of_carries` is calculated as r - q,
      where r are the `discount_rates` and q is `continuous_dividends`. Either
      this or `cost_of_carries` can be given.
      Default value: `None`, equivalent to q = 0.
    cost_of_carries: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `volatilities` and of the shape that broadcasts with `volatilities`.
      Cost of storing a physical commodity, the cost of interest paid when
      long, or the opportunity cost, or the cost of paying dividends when short.
      If not `None`, and `spots` is supplied, used to calculate forwards from
      `spots`: F = e^(bT) * S, where F is the forwards price, b is the cost of
      carries, T is expiries and S is the spot price. If `None`, value assumed
      to be equal to the `discount_rate` - `continuous_dividends`
      Default value: `None`, equivalent to b = r.
    discount_factors: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `volatilities`. If not `None`, these are the discount factors to expiry
      (i.e. e^(-rT)). Mutually exclusive with discount_rate and cost_of_carry.
      If neither is given, no discounting is applied (i.e. the undiscounted
      option price is returned). If `spots` is supplied and `discount_factors`
      is not `None` then this is also used to compute the forwards to expiry.
      At most one of discount_rates and discount_factors can be supplied.
      Default value: `None`, which maps to -log(discount_factors) / expiries
    is_call_options: A boolean `Tensor` of a shape compatible with
      `volatilities`. Indicates whether the option is a call (if True) or a put
      (if False). If not supplied, call options are assumed.
    is_normal_volatility: An optional Python boolean specifying whether the
      `volatilities` correspond to lognormal Black volatility (if False) or
      normal Black volatility (if True).
      Default value: False, which corresponds to lognormal volatility.
    dtype: Optional `tf.DType`. If supplied, the dtype to be used for conversion
      of any supplied non-`Tensor` arguments to `Tensor`.
      Default value: `None` which maps to the default dtype inferred by
        TensorFlow.
    name: str. The name for the ops created by this function.
      Default value: `None` which is mapped to the default name `option_price`.

  Returns:
    option_prices: A `Tensor` of the same shape as `forwards`. The Black
    Scholes price of the options.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If both `forwards` and `spots` are supplied or if neither is
      supplied.
    ValueError: If both `discount_rates` and `discount_factors` is supplied.
    ValueError: If both `continuous_dividends` and `cost_of_carries` is
      supplied.
